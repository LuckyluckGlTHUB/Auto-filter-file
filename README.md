This program has the ability to filter the file in your FTP in some conditions. I use it to delete backup files but it's automatic. So i don't have to comeback every week and delete files.

In his global form, the program keep the file with the most space, because every week a backup should be take more space than the week before.

So how work the program ? 
First it's for .txt file but you can change it if you want.
If there is only one txt file the program don't delete this file, it means you can run it all day if you want to it won't delete your last backup file.

I put a security on it, if there is only one file and that the next backup file is at 0 octet he will not delete the two files.

Finally, the program doesn't care about the other files or folders (except if you told him to delete them) you can put other file in your path.
